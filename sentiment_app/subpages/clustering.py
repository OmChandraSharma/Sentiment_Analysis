    - All clustering methods failed to detect all sentiment classes due to **heavy class imbalance**.
    - **BoW** consistently performed better than TF-IDF across all models.
    - Clusters were generally centered around the **Negative** class, skewing all metrics.
    - **PCA visualizations** provided better insight into cluster formation than confusion matrices.

    **Recommendations:**
    - Balance the dataset or apply class weights for more meaningful cluster assignments.
    - Try advanced vectorization techniques like Word2Vec or BERT for deeper semantic understanding.
    - Semi-supervised approaches could guide clustering more effectively in imbalanced datasets.
